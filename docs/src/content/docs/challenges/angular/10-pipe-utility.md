<div class="chip">Challenge #10</div>

The goal of this serie of 3 pipe challenges is to master PIPES in Angular.

Pure pipe are a very useful way to transform data from your template. The difference between calling a function and a pipe is that pure pire are memoized. So they won't be recalculated every change detection cycle if the inputs hasn't changed.

## Information:

In this third exercice, you want to access utils functions. Currently we cannot access them directly from your template. The goal is to create a specific pipe for this utils file where you will need to pass the name of the function you want to call and the needed arguments.

## Constraints:

- must be strongly typed
