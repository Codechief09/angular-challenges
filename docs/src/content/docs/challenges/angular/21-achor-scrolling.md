<div class="chip">Challenge #21</div>

## Information

You begin with an application that has basic navigation and anchor navigation in the `HomeComponent`. However, using `href` recreates the path each time and refreshes the page.

## Statement

- Your task is to refactor this application to use the built-in navigation tool to better fit within the Angular Framework. You can explore the router, but it's better to stay within the template and use the `RouterLink` directive.
- To improve the user experience, add smooth scrolling.

:::note
Start the project by running: `npx nx serve anchor-scrolling`.
