## Information

In Angular, content projection is a powerful technique for creating highly customizable components. Utilizing and understanding the concepts of <b>ng-content</b> and <b>ngTemplateOutlet</b> can sighificantly enhance your ability to create shareable components.

You can learn all about <b>ng-content</b> [here](https://angular.io/guide/content-projection#projecting-content-in-more-complex-environments) from simple projection to more complex ones.

To learn about <b>ngTemplateOutlet</b>, you can find the API documentation [here](https://angular.io/api/common/NgTemplateOutlet) along with some basic examples.

With this two tools in hand, you are now ready to take on the challenge.

## Statement

You will start with an fully functional application that includes a dashboard containing a teacher card and a student card. The goal is to implement the city card.

While the application works, the developer experience is far from being optimal. Every time you need to implement a new card, you have to modify the `card.component.ts`. In real-life projects, this component can be shared among many applications. The goal of the challenge is to create a `CardComponent` that can be customized without any modifications. Once you've created this component, you can begin implementing the `CityCardComponent` and ensure you are not touching the `CardComponent`.

## Constraints

- You <b>must</b> refactor the `CardComponent` and `ListItemComponent`.
- The `NgFor` directive must be declared and remain inside the `CardComponent`. You might be tempted to move it to the `CardComponent` but avoid doing so.
- `CardComponent` should not contain any `NgIf` or `NgSwitch`.
- CSS: try to avoid using `::ng-deep`. Find a better way to handle CSS styling.
