## Information

Styling is an important part of a day job of a frontend developer often underestimated. In Angular application, I often see people use `@Input()` to customize the style of their component. But `@Input()` should be used only for the logic and we should use other technique for styling. We can take advantage of css variable and host-context.

In this challenge, you will need to use both to delete all `@Input()` from your code.

However, `@Input()` should only be used for logic; and other techniques, such as CSS variables and host-context, should be used for styling.

In this challenge, you will need to use both CSS variables and :host-context to remove all `@Input()` from your code.

## Constraints:

- In your final submission, your component should not contain any lines of code. All styling should be handled within the decorator _(or external css files if you prefer)_
