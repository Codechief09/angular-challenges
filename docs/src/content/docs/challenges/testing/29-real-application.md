## Statement:

I built this more real life application to create more real life test cases.
In this application, you can search for tickets, you can assign or finish them. You can also create new tickets.

This is a very simple application, but it will let you deal with asynchronous task and mocks

The goal of this challenge is to write all test cases of `ticket.store` , `list.component` and `row.component` with Testing Library.

You can also do it with cypress.
