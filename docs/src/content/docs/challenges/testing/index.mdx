In this series of challenges about testing, you will learn how to write <b>Integration tests</b> using [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Cypress Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview).

The benefits of using Testing Library or Cypress Component Testing are to test your component as a black box. You will only interact with what the user can do on the UI. However, the difference with end-to-end tests is that the backend is mocked, which makes the tests faster and more maintainable.
The goal is to mock as little as possible to test your component at a higher level than unit testing, which will make refactoring easier.
Within a real application, integration tests are the tests you will write the most. Learning how to write them will make your application more robust and more maintainable.

Here is a series of 8 challenges that you can take in any order.
