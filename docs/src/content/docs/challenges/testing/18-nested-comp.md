<div class="chip">Challenge #18</div>

## Statement:

We have a small application that send a title to a fake backend that you type inside a input.
If the title is correctly typed, you can send the request otherwise you get a nice error and the request is not sent.
You can play with it by running : `npx nx serve testing-nested`.

The goal is to test this behavior with Testing library and Cypress

The file named `child.component.spec.ts` will let test your application using Testing Library. To run the test suits, you need to run `npx nx test testing-nested`. You can also install [Jest Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) to execute your test by clicking on the `Run` button above each `describe` or `it` blocks.

For testing cypress, you will execute your test inside the `child.component.cy.ts` and run `npx nx component-test testing-nested` to execute your test suits. You can add the `--watch` flag to execute your test in watch mode.

I created some `it` blocks but feel free to add more test if you like to.
