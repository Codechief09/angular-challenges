## Statement:

The objective of this challenge is to have a better understanding of the CDK test harness API. In this initial challenge, we will only use Angular Material's built-in harnesses.

The goal is to test the functionality of `child.component.ts`. I have prepared a test suite that you need to implement, but feel free to include additional tests as well.

**Note:** You are welcome to use Testing Library if you wish.

Documentation for CDK Component Harness is [here](https://material.angular.io/cdk/test-harnesses/overview#api-for-test-authors)
Documentation for Angular Material component is [here](https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview)
