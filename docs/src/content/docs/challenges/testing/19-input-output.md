## Information:

We have a small counter application that increments or decrements a number. The `CounterComponent` takes an initial value as an `@Input` and emits the result of the counter as an `@Output` when we click on the **Send** button. Since we are testing our component as a black box, we only have access to our inputs and listen to the output values. <b>We should not rely on any internal implementation details!!!</b>

You can play with it by running : `npx nx serve test-input-output`.

The file named `counter.component.spec.ts` will let test your application using Testing Library. To run the test suits, you need to run `npx nx test test-input-output`. You can also install [Jest Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) to execute your test by clicking on the `Run` button above each `describe` or `it` blocks.

For testing cypress, you will execute your test inside the `child.component.cy.ts` and run `npx nx component-test test-input-output` to execute your test suits. You can add the `--watch` flag to execute your test in watch mode.

# Statement

The goal is to test multiple behaviors of the application describe inside each test files using Testing library and Cypress Component Testing.

:::note
I have created some `it` blocks but feel free to add more tests if you want.
