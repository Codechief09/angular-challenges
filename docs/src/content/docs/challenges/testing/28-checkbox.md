## Information

This is the perfect example to get started with `Testing Library`.

You will need to only check if the button gets enabled when clicking on the checkbox

You can look into debug function to get full power of `Testing Library` like:

- logRoles(...);
- screen.debug(); // you can pass a element as input
- screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL(); // you can pass a element as input

:::note
Start the project by running: `npx nx serve testing-checkbox`.
