### Information

The goal of this application is to display a list of topics in a modal when a button is clicked. The application functions correctly. However, your tech lead has asked you to add tests and they are failing.

### Statement

Correct your application to pass the test

### Constraints:

- I can see you coming ü§£ => You CANNOT change the test (Test is working fine) üò≥
- You CANNOT change the `fakeGetHttpTopic` method. A delay has been added to fake a slow network.

### Run the test

HEADLESS : `npx nx component-test rxjs-race-condition`
WATCH MODE : `npx nx component-test rxjs-race-condition --watch`

---

:::note
Start the project by running: `npx nx serve rxjs-race-condition`.
