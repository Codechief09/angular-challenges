<div class="chip">Challenge #32</div>

This challenge is inspired by a real-life example that I simplified to create this nice challenge.

## Information

In this small application, we have a navigation menu to route our application to either `barComponent` or `FooComponent`. However our application is not loading and no errors are displayed inside the console.

## Statement

The goal of the challenge is to debug this application and make it work.

## Hints

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  
  If you comment out `routerLinkActive="isSelected"` inside `NavigationComponent`: the application loads correctly.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>

If you open the [`RouterLinkActive` source code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/directives/router_link_active.ts) and go to **line 196**, Angular is calling `this.cdr.markForCheck` inside a microTask which triggers a new CD cycle. If you comment out this line, the application loads again, however the bug is not inside the Angular Framework. üòÖüòØ
