## Information

In this application, we have a list of individuals that we can add, delete or update. If you open the developer Chrome panel by pressing **F12**, go to he <b>source</b> tab, and expand the element to see the list, you will notice that each time, you add, delete or update a list item, the entire DOM elements are destroyed and initialized again. (See video below).

We can also use the <b>Angular DevTool</b> to profile our application and understand what is happening inside our application. I will show you how to do it inside the following video.
