<div class="chip">Challenge #12</div>

## Information

In this challenge, you will need to optimize the change detection cycles run by Angular.

Zone.js triggers a change detection cycle each time a scroll event is dispatched. However we only want to show or hide a button at a specific scroll position. Therefore, we only want to refresh our application once.

> You can vizualise how many times CD is triggered by installing the [Angular chrome devTool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angular-devtools/ienfalfjdbdpebioblfackkekamfmbnh) and starting a new recording on the profiler tab.

The following video will explain what is the goal of this challenge.

</video>

## Statement

Your goal for this challenge is to avoid all unnecessary change detection cycles and trigger a CD only when needed.

## Constraint:

You cannot opt-out of zone.js. If this code is part of a large project and you opt out of zone.js, you will break many things within your application.
