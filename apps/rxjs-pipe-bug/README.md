<h1>BUG: RxJs chaining operators</h1>

> Author: Thomas Laforge

Let's dive inside the wonderful word of RxJs.

This challenge is inspired by a real-life example.

### Presentation of the challenge

#### User Story

We need a button for each `Topic`. When we click on it, we delete all objects with this `Topic` in our database _(Fake DB in our case)_. Finally we display **All [topic] have been deleted** is everything was deleted successfully or **Error: deletion of some [topic] failed** if some deletions failed

#### Constraints:

We can only pass one object to our DB for deletion at the time. The DB will respond true if the data was successfully deleted and false otherwise.

### What you need to do

The QA team reports a **bug**. The UI shows **All [topic] have been deleted** all the time, even if some deletions fail.

ðŸ‘‰ Spot the bug and correct it.
