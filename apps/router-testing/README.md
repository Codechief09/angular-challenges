### Information

Testing is a crucial step in building scalable, maintainable, and trustworthy applications.
Testing should never be avoided, even in the face of short deadlines or strong pressure from the product team.
Nowadays, there are numerous awesome tools available that make it easy to test your code and provide a great developer experience.

In this series of testing exercises, we will learn and master Testing Library that simplifies DOM manipulation for testing any Angular component.
