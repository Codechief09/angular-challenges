<h1>Anchor Scrolling</h1>

> Author: Thomas Laforge

### Information

You begin with an application that has basic navigation and anchor navigation in the `HomeComponent`. However, using `href` recreates the path each time and refreshes the page.

### Statement

- Your task is to refactor this application to use the built-in navigation tool to better fit within the Angular Framework. You can explore the router, but it's better to stay within the template and use the `RouterLink` directive.
- To improve the user experience, add smooth scrolling.

### Submitting your work

1. Fork the project
2. clone it
3. npm ci
4. `npx nx serve anchor-scrolling`
5. _...work on it_
6. Commit your work
7. Submit a PR with a title beginning with **Answer:21** that I will review and other dev can review.
