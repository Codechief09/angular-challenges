<h1>WrapFn pipe</h1>

> Author: Thomas Laforge

The goal of this serie of 3 pipe challenges is to master PIPES in Angular.

Pure pipe are a very useful way to transform data from your template. The difference between calling a function and a pipe is that pure pire are memoized. So they won't be recalculated every change detection cycle if the inputs hasn't changed.

### Information:

In this second exercice, you are calling multiple functions inside your template. You can create a specific pipe for each of the functions but this will be too cumbersome.
The goal is to create a `wrapFn` pipe to wrap your callback function though a pipe. Your function MUST remain inside your component. `WrapFn` must be highly reusable.

### Constraints:

- must be strongly typed

### Submitting your work

1. Fork the project
2. clone it
3. npm ci
4. `npx nx serve pipe-intermediate`
5. _...work on it_
6. Commit your work
7. Submit a PR with a title beginning with **Answer:9** that I will review and other dev can review.
