<h1>interoperability Rxjs and Signal</h1>

> Author: Thomas Laforge

### Information

In this challenge, we have a small reactive application using RxJS and NgRx/Component-Store.

The goal of this challenge is to use the new **Signal API** introduced in Angular v16. However, we should not convert everything. Certain portions of the code are better suited for RxJS rather than Signal. It is up to you to determine the threshold and observe how **Signal and RxJS coexist**, as well as how the interoperability is achieved in Angular.
